## 4. Timeline 
- The first day was mostly spent struggling with my initial choice to switch between Mac and Windows environments, and the resulting mix of environments and commands that came with that. 
- The second day I was catching up doing all the beautifulsoup and selenium exercises, but still struggled with installing a bunch of the environments and packages. Sam helped me out after the end of the day, whenGitHub kept throwing a lot of errors.
- The last day, I started out with the API characters that I hadn't gotten to do before yet. After having finished those. I started on the Wikipedia Scraper notebook, but didn't get to finish it. 

## 5. Personal situation 
This project was done as part of the AI Boocamp at BeCode.org.
